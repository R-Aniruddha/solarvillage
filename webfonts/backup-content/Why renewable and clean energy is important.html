      <h2 class="pb-4"><b>Why renewable and clean energy is important?</b></h2>
      <p>The electricity supply across India lacks quantity and quality due to shortage of supply and transmission and distribution losses because of theft and lack of proper infrastructure. Rural India is primarily affected by this energy shortage. Thus it is common for villages to have long hours of blackouts everyday. This forces rural population to rely on polluting energy sources like firewood, agricultural wastes, animal wastes, and kerosene or diesel generators. These sources severely contribute towards climate change and affects human health. Irregular electricity supply also constrains economic development and affects overall quality of life due to limited access to basic necessities like water, education and hygiene.</p>
      <p>Increasing use of polluting sources for energy generation is contributing towards climate change. According to the United Nations, energy is the dominant contributor towards climate change, accounting for around 60% of total global greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, addressing these energy concerns are important in order to increase India’s electricity generation capacity. It is also important to consider the means for increasing such generation and therefore increasing the share of renewable sources. India is blessed with abundance solar energy and Auroville Consulting aims to install Solar PV Systems in 100 Villages of Tamil Nadu.</p>

            <p>Reliable and continuous power supply allows local manufacturing units and business operations to operate longer and increase their productivity. This leads to increase in income and reduces rural to urban migration in search of work with higher pay.</p>

  <h2 class="pb-3"><b>Solar Village Initiative</b></h2>
    <p>The Solar Village Initiative aims to provide 24x7 equal access to clean, reliable and renewable electricity to the villages in order to achieve sustainable rural development. We aim to increase the share of renewable energy thus reducing the carbon intensity and GHG emission caused by burning fossil fuels and achieve long-term sustainable development goals. In addition with this initiative we plan to shift the existing centralized ownership model in energy industry to a democratic model by transferring ownership to villagers and bring more transparency.</p>
    <p>For each megawatt of Solar PV installed, a revolving fund will increase the installed capacity by a factor of 4 over 18 years. The project objective of powering 100 villages would lead to the socio-economic development and well- being of 1.2 lakh rural citizens of India through sustainable methods. For meeting our target of 100 villages, funds for 25 megawatts of Solar PV systems is required from the Solar Village search engine, Foundation grants and CSR budgets.</p>
